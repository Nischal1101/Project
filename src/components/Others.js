          <p className="leading-relaxed">So yesss...I luckily got the opportunity to learn from Sunilkarkee Sir (@Pedagogy tutions)....üôè
He is an awesome teacher n a guider who guided me as a elder brother ...he not only gave me bookish knowledge but helped me know the outer world...so yes other students feel boring in tution bcoz the tutor comes n just gives the bookish knowledge ..gives homework n goes...but the way he teaches gives us eagerness to read tution...I may be the first one to say that I enjoyed to read tution bcoz I got to learn something new everyday ...he helped me plan things. And yes like other tutors ...he doesn‚Äôt gives limited time ...he gives according to our necessity ...As a student ...I am lucky to find a tutor like my elder brother...even if I ask something at end moment ...he is alwz there to help me...so I am grateful to have a teacher like him.
"Thank you Sunil Karki  sir"üôèüèª</p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">I would like to share my experience as a tutor at Pedagogy Tuitions. The trainings and
           webinars offered by Pedagogy Tuitions have been extremely fruitful for me. The friendly environment and support
            from other tutors has made me feel comfortable and motivated. It's great to see that the management at Pedagogy
             Tuitions values the growth of both students and tutors. I am grateful to be a part of such an amazing team and
              look forward to continuing to contribute to the development of our students..</p>
